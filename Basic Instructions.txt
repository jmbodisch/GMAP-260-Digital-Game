For this GitHub Repository -- 

Code goes in Code folder, simple art assets that are being used go in art assets folder (who would have known...)
UI stuff will also go in art folder

If it is not being used directly in the game, don't put it in the repo, put it in google docs

If a file is large, please let me know before committing it, I need to add an extension to prevent misshaps
